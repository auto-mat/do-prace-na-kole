Welcome among us!

Registration for the {{ campaign }} competition looks good. The ride of your life is about to happen. Are you interested in it? Confirm!

Confirm your email address here {{ activate_url }}.

Once we confirm your address, please take a moment and listen to the Ten Recommendations before the start:

- Get your bike out of the way. Whoever lubricates the chain, rides.

- Start your physical training. Prepare your thighs for a regular morning ride.

- Remember your login email {{ email }}.

- Remember that the challenge starts {{ campaign_competition_phase_date_from }} and ends {{ campaign_competition_phase_date_to }}.

- Record your rides regularly in your {{ routes_calendar_url }} profile.

- Set up your typical route in your profile and logging will be faster than Jan Kavalír's ride.

- Don't forget to {{ profile_details_url }} invite your colleagues to your team.

- Logging your trips with your smartphone is a piece of cake when you download one of the recommended {{campaign_campaign_type_web}}/applications.

- If you're really competitive, keep an eye on the news and the latest competitions from your city on our {{campaign_campaign_type_web}} website.

- We'll be happy to answer any further questions at {{campaign_contact_email}}.{% endblocktrans %}{% endautoescape %}{% endblock %}
