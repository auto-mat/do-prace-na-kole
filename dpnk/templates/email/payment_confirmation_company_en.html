A message for {{ user_attendance }} from the {{user_attendance.team.name}} team in the {{ user_attendance.campaign }} competition from {{ company }}.

Hello,

the {{ company }} company coordinator has just confirmed the payment of your participation fee in the {{ user_attendance.campaign }} competition.

From now on you don't have to worry about the participation fee because {{ company }} will make a payment for multiple participants. Even if the invoice is not paid by the official end of registration, we will consider you a legitimate participant.
You can also look forward to a starting pack with a T-shirt!

Thank you for your registration and we will keep fingers crossed for you not only during the competition itself but especially in the regular and long-term use of your bike to get to work and back.
Your {{ user_attendance.campaign }} organization team
